# Jekyll Gensocial

[![Gem Version](https://badge.fury.io/rb/jekyll-gensocial.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/rb/jekyll-gensocial)

A Jekyll plugin that automatically generates images that will be used when your links are shared on social media.

_^ Here's an example._

## Installation

### Dependencies

First install ImageMagick (and GhostScript if you don't supply your own font):

#### macOS

```bash
brew install pkg-config imagemagick [gs]
```

Add `gem "jekyll-gensocial"` to the `:jekyll_plugins` group in your `Gemfile`:

```ruby
# Gemfile

group :jekyll_plugins do
  gem "jekyll-gensocial"
end
```

#### Linux and Windows

_Haven't tried yet. If you have, please submit a PR._

### Jekyll

Add these lines to your site's `_config.yml`:

```yml
# _config.yml

plugins:
  - jekyll-gensocial
```

## Usage

You can customize the image's background layer and text appearance from your `_config.yml`.

```yaml
# These are the default settings

jekyll-gensocial:
  enabled: true
  size:
    width: 1920
    height: 1080
  background:
    path: nil
  text:
    string: nil
    font_path: nil
    pointsize: 100
    fill: "#000000"
    rect:
      size:
        width: 1600
        height: 500
      origin:
        x: 150
        y: 100
```

Set the `image` front matter in the posts and pages that you want to generate images for.

```yaml
# _posts/2020-03-19-macdevsclub.md

---
layout: post
title:  "Your #1 resource for building, distributing and selling Mac apps. Visit macdevs.club!"
date:   2020-03-19
categories: [swift-ui]
image: assets/img/macdevsclub.jpg
---

The contents of your post goes here.
```

### Overrides

You can override the default settings on a per post/page basis.

```yaml
# _posts/2020-03-19-macdevsclub.md

---
layout: post
title:  "Your #1 resource for building, distributing and selling Mac apps. Visit macdevs.club!"
date:   2020-03-19
categories: [swift-ui]
image: assets/img/macdevsclub.jpg
jekyll-gensocial:
  text:
    string: "Let's display something else"
    fill: "#ff0000" # And make it red
---

The contents of your post goes here.
```

### Example

```yaml
# Features a background image, text fill color and custom font

jekyll-gensocial:
  background:
    path: "_assets/img/gensocial_bg.jpg"
  text:
    fill: "#2d3748"
    font_path: "_assets/fonts/Lato-Regular.ttf"
```

## Purpose

Used in conjuction with the [`jekyll-seo-tag`](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll-seo-tag) plugin, this automatically improves how your links look when shared online.

Instead of having to create a new image for every page and post, why not automate the process.

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `script/bootstrap` to install dependencies. Then, run `bundle exec rake spec` to run the tests.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `lib/jekyll-gensocial/version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).

### Stuff to work on

* Expand testing to verify image output.
